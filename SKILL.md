# Leaderless Coordination

A skill for designing actions and movements that require no central command, hierarchy, or formal organization - enabling collective action without coordination.

## When to Use

- When leaders would be targeted and removed
- When formal organization creates legal vulnerability
- When you want action that can't be stopped by decapitation
- When rapid, unpredictable response is needed

## Inputs

1. **The goal**: What collective action are you trying to enable?
2. **The participants**: Who might join, and what are their capabilities?
3. **The constraints**: What makes formal organization dangerous or impossible?
4. **Communication**: What channels exist for non-coordinated coordination?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine what "winning" looks like:

- What outcome counts as success?
- How would you know if you achieved it?
- Can success be recognized by participants independently?

### Step 2: Create actions anyone can take independently:

- Clear enough that participants know what to do
- Flexible enough that local adaptation is possible
- Recognizable enough that actions are attributed correctly
- Simple enough that no training is required

### Step 3: Build in adaptation:

- How do tactics change as circumstances change?
- How do new ideas spread?
- How are failed approaches abandoned?
- How does the movement grow or contract?



## Output Format

A leaderless coordination design including:
1. Success definition that requires no central assessment
2. Self-selecting actions anyone can take
3. Removed coordination requirements
4. Identity markers and recognizable symbols
5. Communication norms
6. Evolution mechanisms

## Constraints

- Some goals genuinely require coordination - acknowledge limits
- Leaderless can mean inconsistent and unreliable
- Bad actors can claim affiliation easily
- Strategic direction is difficult without leadership
- May be outmaneuvered by coordinated opponents

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Design leaderless coordination for resistance to unjust policy

**Output**:
"Success: Policy becomes unenforceable or is withdrawn. Recognizable without central assessment - news coverage will confirm. Self-selecting actions: Three tiers anyone can choose from - Tier 1 (low risk): display symbol, share information, attend public events; Tier 2 (medium risk): non-compliance with policy, documentation of enforcement; Tier 3 (high risk): direct interference with enforcement. Removed requirements: No synchronized timing ('ongoing'), no central location ('everywhere it's enforced'), no tracked participation ('we don't count, we act'). Identity: Distinctive hand symbol, color, hashtag. Communication: Public channels for proposals and outcome sharing; anyone can suggest, adoption is organic. Evolution: What spreads is what works; share success stories widely."

## Integration

Works with:
- **collective-action-design**: Alternative structure for collective action
- **swarm-operations**: Specific type of leaderless action
- **memetic-warfare**: How ideas spread without central coordination
